## Multilingual EAS SAME ENDEC Program

An emergency alert ENDEC C++/Python app that outputs text to be interpreted in many languages.
**ONLY WORKS IN THE UNITED STATES.** *Other countries using SAME-protocol alerting (eg. Mexico's SISMEX, Environment Canada, etc.) COMING SOON.*

#### What it does
This ENDEC outputs all parameter values that are required in a SAME-encoded emergency message.
It accepts any input of SAME-encoded messages; FM radio, AM radio, WB radio (NOAA WX Radio), TV, etc.
The data the app returns can be interpreted in your custom app or software project.
I will be using this library in a weather dashboard, AEOE WX Dashboard, as a free, public demonstration of this C++/Python hybrid ENDEC app.
